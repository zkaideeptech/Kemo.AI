# KEMO Rules

- Stack is fixed: Next.js App Router + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + next-intl + Supabase + Stripe.
- Do not introduce unnecessary frameworks or state management libraries.
- Do not change the agreed architecture (async jobs, providers, pipeline).
- Do not commit or expose secrets. Keep keys in server-only env.
- Never use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in the browser.
- Keep /src structure clean and consistent.
- Use API response format: { ok, data } or { ok: false, error }.
- Long tasks must not run in HTTP handlers in production.
